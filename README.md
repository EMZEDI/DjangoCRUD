# Welcome to my CRUD website documentation! 
To run the website and use it, you have to make sure that you have python 3.9 installed:
To make sure, do the following tasks:
Download the repository and place it into your desktop and name it <b>djangoProject</b> <br>
1- install Pycharm Community version from here: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download <br>
2- Open pycharm and create a new project using the button on the right top of the page.<br>
3- Make sure the python version used is 3.7 or above (3.9 recommended) make sure to check the button where it says <b>New environment using: Virtualenv</b> along with the project.<br>
4- Choose the repository folder in the desktop as your project folder And make the project!! You have to choose the "Create Project using the existing sources" option.<br>
5- When you enter the project, wait for a minute or so, to make sure pycharm installs everything.<br>
6- Go to the terminal and type <code> chmod u+x run.sh </code>.<br>
7- Last step, in terminal type <code> ./run.sh </code>. <br>
8- Wait until pycharm does everything for you. You will see a link after <b><code>Starting development server at</b></code>; this may take up to 30 seconds (python has to install packages). Click the link and you are good to go!<br>
9- When you are done checking the website, you can press CONTROL + C on the same terminal tab as before to stop the server.

# Functionality of the website
1- Add inventory items that have name, quantity, and price. <br>
2- CRUD functionality which lets you edit the inventory items and update them as well as deleting them.<br>
3- You can download the information of each inventory item or all of the items as a csv file!<br>
